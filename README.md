## Disclaimer

This project serves as an experimental tool and is not endorsed or affiliated with Google. Infact the opposite; reverse engineered from search sources. It operates under the assumption that Google has an audio file for every English word, which might not always be the case. Therefore, occasional errors due to non-existent files should be expected. Despite these limitations, the tool provides a simple, effective way to aid in language annuciation and conceptualization.

## Description

Exploration into auditory learning, using web technologies. This project harnesses the power of Google's pronunciation audio files to facilitate language learning, specifically, word pronunciation.

The project utilizes HTML5 and JavaScript. It uses audio, input field, and button elements in HTML5. JavaScript manages the fetching and playing of audio files based on the user's input. 

Users can enter a word and then press a button or the 'Enter' key to hear its pronunciation. There is also a slow mode option that can be toggled via a checkbox. 

In case of errors (like non-existent audio files), an error message is presented to the user.
